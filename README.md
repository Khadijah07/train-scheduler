# train-scheduler

Overview

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.



When adding trains, passengers should be able to submit the following:


Train Name


Destination


First Train Time -- in military time


Frequency -- in minutes



Technologies used:

Moment.js
Firebase
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT
Jquery
